    <h2>Summary of Readings</h2>
    
    <p>These two articles regard design and how/why it is created. The piece by Bardzell/ Bardzell/Stolterman discuss a critical design. They lay out what it is, how it should function, and the roles it should play. Spool’s work takes aim at how a design is crafted and, as a result, executed. The common thread between both of them is that a design’s purpose (both in a pragmatic and/or a utilitarian sense), lays squarely and solely on the creators of it. The two examples that Bardzell/ Bardzell/Stolterman spend the most time on are the porcupine dress and the teddy bear blood bag radio. They asses that these are both critical designs, mostly because of their opposition to social norms. Yet one, the porcupine dress also takes on a pragmatic function: self-defense. The blood bad radio’s design is centered moreso on the shock factor that will be conjured in the minds of the beholders, or so the designers hope. It seems to like any sort of special utilizable function that makes it more appealing to the consumer. Indeed its only physical functions it that it emits an audible signal from radio waves. The same might be said for the porcupine dress, though certainly to a lesser degree. As the authors note, the actual efficiency of the dress as a self-defense weapon may be in question; but the impression it makes certainly is not in question. Most likely, that is the purpose behind the creation of this design: to “send a message” or “start a conversation” about a social issue that the dress appears to address. This is where Spool’s thesis ties into by Bardzell/ Bardzell/Stolterman’s. Spool asserts that the design of a product is based almost solely on the intention the designers have for the product’s function. The creators of the teddy bear blood bag radio were aiming for something that shocked people and initiated conversation. So, in a pragmatic sense, the product fulfills its designer’s intent. Thought from a utilitarian standpoint, if one works off Spool’s thesis, the designers put little thought into the product’s actual use, because from that angle it is only a radio with an alternative power source. The designers of the porcupine dress also had a similar pragmatic intent: to get people talking (or at least thinking) about violence against women. And simultaneously, they install a utilitarian purpose for the product as well. Though, the assumption could be safely made that the former was the primary intent over the later.</p>
    <p> Designs, partially those of the critical nature, do not exist without intent. Intent drives what the purpose and actual use (or lack thereof) of a product will be. The raw intent of a design, even a critical design, does not incorporate a lot of critical judgement. It seems that the intent behind products that truly make a mark on society are unfettered by questions on how the intent might be improved. However, critical judgements and the improvements that consequently result are essential to any good product design and execution.</p>
    
    <h2>Quote</h2>
    
    <p>“We look for places where we could do something that would improve the users’ experience.”</p>
    <p>In this quote, Spool is discussing how the intent of design is formed. I found this interesting because it is basically the same as Bardzell/ Bardzell/Stolterman’ “critical judgment” concept. Both involve taking a hard look at a design, and afterwards crafting or altering the design that is set to be crafted.</p>
    
    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Do you think that the more passionate an intent is, the more inherently critical the design becomes?</li>
        <li>Bardzell/ Bardzell/Stolterman say that there basically is no one good way to classify a critical design, but sometimes many different ways that are equally valid (1956). However, how many we try to classify the design of the “VT-shaped” student?</li>
        <li>Are all designs naturally critical? That is, are they always trying to “question” the norms set by another design?</li>
    </ul>
